OSCshellRCs
==========

a collection of my SHell aliases, functions, and descriptive menus for those alias shortcuts. 

So far I have created folders in the name of .<SHELKL>rc/ that will contain reference files, that will reference various alias, function, options, VARIABLE, and menu-files. This will make my Shell configurations hightly personalized and similar, no matter which shell I choose to employ.

I have created a custom I-python3 shell environment.
I have three profiles within my Ipython shell.
    Default = ipy bash alias to see how the default environment works
    custom(highly verbose) = ipyc bash alias made for maximum comfort
    degugging = ipyd bash alias built for a default + debugging options combo
    
Utilities needed to make my bash work perfectly:
?goto an alternative to the broken autojump for quickly navigating to bookmarked locations
exa ls replacement written in rust, and installed with cargo rust's package mgr.
bat cat replacement with line numbers/auto-paging/theming(color matching)
