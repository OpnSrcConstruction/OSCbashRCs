OSCshellRCs
==========

a collection of my SHell aliases, functions, and descriptive menus for those alias shortcuts. 

So far I have created folders in the name of .<SHELKL>rc/ that will contain reference files, that will reference various alias, function, options, VARIABLE, and menu-files. This will make my Shell configurations hightly personalized and similar, no matter which shell I choose to employ.

I have created a custom I-python3 shell environment.
I have three profiles within my Ipython shell.
    Default = ipy bash alias to see how the default environment works
    custom(highly verbose) = ipyc bash alias made for maximum comfort
    degugging = ipyd bash alias built for a default + debugging options combo
    
Utilities needed to make my bash work perfectly:
exa ls replacement written in rust, and installed with cargo rust's package mgr.
bat cat replacement with line numbers/auto-paging/theming(color matching)
bd  back-directory Change into any directory in the path of the current working directory
cbxmanager.py create .cbz files from directories of comic scans.
