OSCshellRCs
==========

a collection of my SHell aliases, functions, and descriptive menus for those alias shortcuts. 

So far I have created folders in the name of .<SHELKL>rc/ that will contain reference files, that will reference various alias, function, options, VARIABLE, and menu-files. This will make my Shell configurations hightly personalized and similar, no matter which shell I choose to employ.

I also hope to add I-Python(3), and Power-shell configs in the future.
