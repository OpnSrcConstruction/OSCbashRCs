OSCshellRCs
==========

a collection of my SHell aliases, functions, and descriptive menus for those alias shortcuts. 

So far I have created folders in the name of .<SHELKL>rc/ that will contain reference files, that will reference various alias, function, options, VARIABLE, and menu-files. This will make my Shell configurations hightly personalized and similar, no matter which shell I choose to employ.

I have created a custom I-python3 shell environment.
I have three profiles within my Ipython shell...
~Default
~custom(highly verbose)
~degugging
